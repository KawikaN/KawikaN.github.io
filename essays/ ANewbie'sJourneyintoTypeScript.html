            <h2>Introduction to TypeScript</h2>
            <p>ICS 314 was my first experience being exposed to TypeScript. I've heard of the programming language when looking at tech stacks of many web pages, including many notable names like Microsoft, Google, and Meta. This made me more than excited to learn it and expand my "toolbox".</p>
            
            <h2>Learning TypeScript: A JavaScript Perspective</h2>
            <p>Due to the similarities to JavaScript, which I had some experience with, I could spend more time learning the benefits and capabilities rather than focusing on the simple functionality and syntax. Although it seemed to be less intuitive than other high-level languages like Python and JavaScript, it really has grown on me. I found myself liking the ability to define types and see in-depth where/how my data is flowing.</p>
            
            <h2>TypeScript's Advantages in Software Engineering</h2>
            <p>Due to TypeScript's safety features and qualities added upon JavaScript’s (covering some of its shortcomings), it seems to be a powerful tool that is beneficial to many software engineering applications. Specifically, we see attributes that support long-term maintenance and collaboration by preventing issues from arising when initially writing code. It also gives a clearer idea of what is happening within a program through its types.</p>
            
            <h2>Integrating TypeScript into Future Projects</h2>
            <p>This is why I will be developing my future projects with some implementation of TypeScript. Remember, your entire project doesn't need to be in a single language. Even if you aren't completely comfortable rolling over your entire codebase to TypeScript, you may be interested in developing some features in TS and others in JS, for example. This is a good approach to benefit from both languages where they are the strongest.</p>
            
            <h2>The Growing Popularity of TypeScript</h2>
            <p>The conversations surrounding TS reflect that many people still prefer JavaScript as their go-to. But this may be changing... In recent years, we have also seen a constant shift towards more programmers writing in TS. We also continuously see more websites built with some sort of TS in the background. According to SDTIMES.com, TypeScript has "grown from 12% in 2017 to 37% in 2024, underscoring its increasing popularity among developers."</p>
