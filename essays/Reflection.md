# Introduction

The role & use of AI has been sneaking its way into the development process of many developers worldwide. We have seen the power of AI with many tools having access to information across the web, summarize textbooks quickly, and now even develop code. Because of these tools AI can be a powerful source for learning but also a hindrance. It allows students to skip over the mundane task and shifts their focus on the portions that require diligence. On the other hand, AI is often treated as a substitute and replacement for human involvement and this is where it is easy for students to make that mistake. If you as the programmer do not understand what is going on under the hood and just blindly allow AI to develop your entire program often you will be stuck debugging a codebase that seems to be unsavable. This is why it is important for a student to learn to integrate AI in a way that they are still learning while streamlining the process. I found AI tools like Cursor, ChatGPT, and Gemini helpful. My current approach consist of letting these tools assist me with the outline code and allows me to come in and refine it to get the app working quicker. 

# Personal Experience with AI

## Experience WODs e.g. E18

At first I attempted to feed the whole prompts into AI and tweak the code from there. For example, during the E12: Jamba Juice 1 I had fed the entire prompt into ChatGPT. This process did not yield very quick times as AI had a hard time understanding the prompts to their full affect. Later in the course I figured out that it was more efficient to figure out a path to the solution myself and then have AI assist me in this process. This yielded high results as it avoided AI making incorrect development decisions but also created a quicker development process.

## In-class Practice WODs

I tried to focus on doing the work myself with practice WODs as it was a time that allowed you to develop your skills and learn. Because it was ungraded it gave me the freedom to just focus on learning without worrying about it harming me. It is important to struggle through the problems because this is where the learning process happens. 

## In-class WODs

For in-class WODs AI was heavily prominent in my development process. For the first WODs I was feeding AI the entire prompt and trying to debug the returned code. This worked fine at first but became too difficult and slow for much more complex WODs. Similar to experiencing WODs I learned that it was much more effective to read the context myself develop a plan for a solution and have AI help me implement this plan. AI was especially helpful on these because the time constraint was important to our grade. 

## Essays

For essays, I wrote the paragraphs myself and then passed it into a LLM like ChatGPT to see suggestions about how I can correct grammar and the sound of conversation. It was also very helpful in creating the Markdown formatting for our portfolios. An example prompt would be,” How might I make this sound more professional?”. 

## Final Project

For the final project, I tried to have AI do my portion of the code. I mainly used the Cursor here as it had the context of the entire codebase and could constantly prompt itself til the result was achieved. The issue was that Cursor was having a hard time achieving the solutions for the task I had set. Additionally, for most of my tasks for the final project, I actually did not have to code but rather I researched and worked with other group members to implement it on their end. 

## Learning a Concept / Tutorial

I just AI heavily here because I wanted to get it done quickly. Towards the end of the class, I realized that I wish I had spent more time on these tutorials and I will likely go back to redo most of them myself. This is because I now rely on AI solely to run commands like npx prims migrate. These are trivial commands and understanding them is mandatory. On the other hand, AI can answer questions and explain things deeper for a greater understanding. 

## Answering a Question in Class or in Discord

I never used AI to answer a question because I believed that it was important to try to think about the questions and not just answer the questions regardless. Also, I knew that others would search for the answer anyway so it gave me time to think about what I knew. 

## Asking or Answering a Smart Question

I have never interacted with the smart-question channel although I found myself reading through them often to understand the issues that other students were having. I found it very useful in solving common problems. 

## Coding Example (e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”)

I never caught myself asking AI for an example of coding. This is because I would ask more specific questions than an entire code example. Although, now that I think about it, this would be an amazing use of AI in the learning process.

## Explaining Code

I use AI very often to explain portions of code especially if that portion was written by another team member or imported from a template, library, etc. For example, when working on the final project many of the team members were implementing various versions of their API calls and I had to use AI to explain this to me. This allowed me to understand the context surrounding implementations. 

## Writing Code

AI was a very important tool in my development process due to its use of context, wide knowledge, and quick development. I try to implement it everywhere it can be and am constantly looking for more ways to use it effectively. 

## Documenting Code

I have never used AI for documentation but I would have it summarize things that I can use to eventually write the documentation. 

## Quality Assurance (e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”)

I used Cursor to solve ESLint errors every time I or AI wrote code. It had a difficult time correcting this errors so I often would have to manually go in after it to correct anything it had a struggle working with.

## Other Uses in ICS 314 Not Listed

I have no other major uses for AI in ICS 314.

# Impact on Learning and Understanding

Looking back at it AI has definitely hindered my learning within this course. I much rather have spent the time learning all the topics and struggle (and probably got worse scores) for the benefit of understanding the material completely. Although, now I know how to use AI more efficiently for learning. In the future I will be able to streamline the learning process and apply it to more than coding. 

# Practical Applications

I have implemented AI outside of ICS 314 often. It helps in nearly every single course and project I work on. For example, my internship ask me to do task by the week and every week I can shift my focuses quickly with the help of AI. The application of AI is greater than ICS 314 and learning, it has uses in everywhere in our lives. With the correct process it can make all of us more efficient. 

# Challenges and Opportunities

The biggest challenge that I faced was writing effective prompts for AI. The output of any prompt is only ever as good as the explanation it is given. This is why it is important that you are able to provide AI with the entire context and guidance. Additionally, this integrates with the idea of ensuring that you understand the goal and the techniques involved. If you rely solely on AI for this you are unable to identify issues and mistakes when they appear in the code. It also limits your ability to guide the development process and make efficient choices. This is the major challenge when it comes to integrating AI into my workflow. 

# Comparative Analysis

Without AI, most students would build a stronger foundation at the cost of a slower pace and often covering less topics. This also creates a bigger gap between each student as some students will develop quicker than others. With AI, most students will be able to cover a broader range of topics. Additionally, the gaps between each student will be smaller as there is less overhead required for each task. On the flip side, students will likely to have less understanding of topics if AI is not used efficiently. I think this is why it is important that we teach students how to use AI and not try to avoid it nor “let students figure it out”. I think that it is just another tool for students to improve their learning process and it is ultimately up to each student to decide the best tool for them. 

# Future Considerations

I think that AI will always appear in software engineering education. Because AI is very new it is still being figured out how to utilize it for the better learning of students effectively. This is why I believe that it will only become easier to use AI for learning in the future with the discovery of new formal techniques, tools, and restrictions. I think that schools will be doing students injustice if they do not address the importance of AI and create a strong focus on teaching students how to use it effectively to improve the learning process and not try to avoid it entirely. 

# Conclusion

Overall, my experience with AI in ICS 314 has taught me that it is a powerful tool for developers. It has numerous educational applications that can both benefit and harm students from learning the topics of software engineering. Although it can help overcome challenges it can create weaker foundations of fundamentals. This highlights the importance of using specific learning techniques with AI to avoid damaging students' understanding. Students often are in a vulnerable position where they will sacrifice their understanding for a better grade and to complete assignments quickly. This brings to the surface the danger of overreliance on AI in software engineering. My greatest feedback for the course would be that some sections students must complete without the use of AI. This would force students to gain the necessary foundation while also learning how to integrate AI into their workflow and use it effectively. I also believe that a portion of the in-person WODs should not allow the use of AI but should be simpler than the ones that do(just to check general understanding).
