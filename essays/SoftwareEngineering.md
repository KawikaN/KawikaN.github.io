## Benefits
Software engineering is often referred to as a lucrative career which holds many opportunities. This is likely one of the driving factors why I pursue it but not the only one. 

### Underated Views
What is slightly less talked about when speaking on the subject is how software engineering applies to someone who thrives on problem-solving and analytical thinking. Similar to other engineering fields a software engineer must break down large problems into smaller pieces and have them work in sync with one another. With such a vast field and application there are many solutions to any given problem. This allows a developer to choose the approach that matches them the best and at times, "Get creative". 

### The Computer Scientist Brain
On top of problem-solving, software engineers must think about how to optimize programs and understand how different components of the program interact to create a product. This can make it difficult for those who may not be used to computer science concepts. Some say it takes a special line of thinking that is rarely found elsewhere.

## Personal Take-Aways
Personally, not only does software engineering allow me to exercise my logical and complex thinking but it also allows me to make real-life impacts on the world around me. I am able to improve and make people's lives easier. This is important to me because I would like to feel like my work is important to the world. I don't want to just have a "job". 

### My Goal
This is why I want to develop not only technical skills but also soft people skills so that I am capable of providing solutions to people's needs whether that is in my community or the world. 

## Final Message
Throughout my career, I hope to  witness my impact on those around me and provide for those who need it most.
